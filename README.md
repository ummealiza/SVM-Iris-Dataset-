# SVM-Iris-Dataset-
In this SVM model, I have used Iris daatset in which I have done pre-processing, checked accuracy and f1 score, find bias and variance of the model ,done cross validation and checked its accuracy on it . In addition to this, I have saved the trained model , then uploaded that model, then took input from user and predicted output from the loaded model.
